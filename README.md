This is the Static Code Analyzer project I made myself.

In this project, you will create a simple static analyzer tool that finds common stylistic issues in Python code. You will get a general idea of static code analysis and expand your competence in Python.

Here's the link to the project: [https://hyperskill.org/projects/173](https://hyperskill.org/projects/112?track=2)
